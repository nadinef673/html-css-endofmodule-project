        <h1 class="option">Castle of Good Hope</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In 1652 the first Europeans landed on the shores of South Africa with the intention to establish a supply depot for ships of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) – a fort was erected in 1666 and by 1679 it had turned into the Castle of Good Hope as it stands today. It’s the oldest surviving building of South Africa’s colonial era and one of the most popular.

          <p class="paragraph">
            One of South Africa’s most famous historical landmarks is Robben Island, located in Table Bay, just west of the city. During the Apartheid years the prison on the island was home to many prominent political prisoners, including its most famous former resident, Nelson Mandela, who served 18 of his 27 year sentence here. In 1997 a museum was established to commemorate the struggle that political prisoners had to endure on the island.
