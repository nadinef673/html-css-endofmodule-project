                    <td class="row"> Like most cities with a population of 5 million people, there is crime in certain areas and during different times of the day. Being mindful and keeping vigilant is key. For me, during the day walking around in the city and in certain areas is absolutely fine.</td>

                    <td class="row"> Why do a tour in Cape Town? </td>
                    <td class="row"> We have hand picked our guides according to their life experience and knowledge of the city. You will hear stories unheard of by the general public and see things that you would not usually take notice of if walking past yourself. Cape Town is a massive city, so getting around to places like Cape Point, Penguins at Boulders Beach in Simon’s Town or wineries around Stellenbosch requires a lot of driving. Our tours are very cost effective when on a budget. There are many places to go out and drink at – so why take the risk of drink driving when you can pay for a knowledgeable local to drive you around the whole day and enjoy some world-class wine, craft beer or gin! June to August is winter time, where traditionally Cape Town is meant to get all of its rainfall, but obviously due to the recent drought the last few years have been a very dry and pleasant winter (even though we need the rain!). August to October is an amazing time to be in Cape Town. Not only is it starting to warm up, but the Whales are in town! It’s almost impossible not to spot a whale breaching while driving along the coastal roads during this time, so it’s quite a popular time of year to come.</td>

                    <td class="row"> Peak season in Cape Town is in the summer months, which starts in November until February, where tourists flock to the city due to the warm and dry weather. If you love the beach and festive atmosphere, then this is probably the best time to come to Cape Town. Summer is also when the wind pumps the most, so if you don’t dig the wind, then best to wait until February/March time.If you want to skip the crowds, but still want to enjoy the nice weather, then March-May is a very good time to come. The weather is still warm and as winter approaches, the leaves of the trees become very pretty.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td class="row"> Where should I stay? </td>
                    <td class="row"> It depends on your budget, but generally anywhere in the ‘City-bowl’ (Gardens, Oranjezicht, Tamboerskloof, De Waterkant, CBD etc.) is a great choice. If you are after more of a beachy-vibe, then expect to pay a lot more with Green Point, Sea Point, Fresnaye, Bantry Bay, Clifton and Camps Bay all being absolutely stunning places to stay. If you want to get out of the city, then you can’t go wrong staying at any wine farm guesthouse in Constantia, Stellenbosch, Franshhoek or Paarl. If you are young, after a party and on a budget, then the best hostel in Cape Town is Once in Cape Town on Kloof St. They call themselves a ‘Poshtel’, with their amenities almost feeling like you are staying at a hotel. Their on-site bar, Yours Truly, is one of the best places to drink in Cape Town and has an awesome mix of locals and foreigners alike. While, if you want your space, then Air BNB is extremely popular in Cape Town with there being plenty of options available.</td>
